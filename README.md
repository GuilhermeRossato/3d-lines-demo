# 3d-lines-demo

A webgl experiment to simulate 3d lines with very little math from a simple quad

# State

Currently it is not working well, I'm strill doing some tests.

# Running Locally

This experiment needs a local web server serving the repository folder to run correctly.

For windows, I recommend installing [PHP](http://google.com) so that you can run `run.bat` and not have to worry about it.

For linux, just run the PHP local webserver locally: `php -S localhost:8080 .`
